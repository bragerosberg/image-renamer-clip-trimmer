# image renamer + clip trimmer
> Personal scripts I've created to automate repetitive tasks when editing, handling or updating media files like images and movies

**TL;DR**: Skip renamining countless amount of files manually, cutting out the intro of video clips. Use scripts that automates them tedious jobs for you.

Are you digitalizing your physical albums containing hundreds, or even thousands of photos? Have you downloaded your favorite movie series, but have an intro you always skip?
This was my case, and I decided to automate whatever I could to spice up the repetitive process (e.g. naming > thousand copies of scanned physical photos ðŸ¤¯)
It was a lot more exciting to take on the challenge to make this a possibility, and oh boy, it felt good when it worked the way I hoped it could, saving me a lot of time. Where I know gladly will name copies of photos to whatever prefix someone wants.

# Full Description
### Image Renaming
Enter the file `renameImage.ts` and navigate to the declared variables on line 12 & 13. 
These are the variables, and their intended usage:
- `fileYear`: What year are the files form (e.g. 2021)
- `prefix`: What context is the file (e.g. June, Wedding, Christmas)

Running the script, `npm run rename`, would update a list of randomly named images and convert them into a more structured format (_see example below_):
```
CEA_enNO808NO808&oq=uuidasd223.png --> Wedding_2021_0.png
d&aqs=12312S/D..69i57j69i59l2j69.png --> Wedding_2021_1.png
1378j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=23.png --> Wedding_2021_2.png
```

### Video trimming
Enter the file `trimMP4.ts` and navigate to the declared variables on line 15 & 16.
These are the variables, and their intended usage:
- `startTime`: when do you want the new start time to be (hh:mm:ss) (e.g. 00:00:00)

 - `clipDuration`: how long do you want the clip to be in seconds (e.g. 30)

Running the script, `npm run trim`, would update the list of videos added to the `/media` folder and convert them into clips like the following (_see example below_):
```
copyRightFreeClip.mp4 (duration 8:25) --> copyRightFreeClip.mp4 (duration 0:30)
anotherCopyRightFreeClip.mp4 (duration 2:55) --> anotherCopyRightFreeClip.mp4 (duration 0:30)
lastCopyRightFreeClip.mp4 (duration 4:56) --> lastCopyRightFreeClip.mp4 (duration 0:30)
```
